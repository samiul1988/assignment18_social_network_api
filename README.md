## My Actions and Notes

* The project was developed from scratch.
* Basic considerations were as follows:
    * Following packages were used: ```express```, ```mongoose```, ```sequelize```, ```dotenv```, ```bcrypt```, ```express-session``` and  ```connect-session-sequelize```
    * Application's folder structure follows MVC paradigm
    * Application was deployed to Heroku
    * For each model, I attempted to create all CRUD apis, some of which return json as response, and some were used in homepage and dashboard page routes to render appropriate views
    * If the authenticated user is idle for 10 mins, then he/she is automatically signed out and returned to homepage
    * I also set the session cookie to be expired in 5 hours
    * I added features so that if the user is logged in, then he/she can delete his/her own comments from any post
